## Mikala Rae Narlock

I'm a research data librarian who believes that good data stewardship is about much more than storage and organization-- it's about building sustainable systems that serve both current needs and future possibilities. I've developed deep expertise in data curation, particularly around the challenging questions of what we preserve, what we let go, and how we make those decisions thoughtfully. My research explores data preservation, retention policies, and deaccessioning practices-- areas where technical knowledge meets ethical responsibility.

This website serves as my independent space to share work, ideas, and reflections that span across institutions and positions. It's where I can think out loud about the field and contribute to conversations that matter to me.

I strive to adopt Slow principles in my professional and personal life-- because what you pay attention to grows (Emergent Strategy) -- and in order to say yes to joy, opportunities, fulfillment, we have to say no sometimes. 

I'm always open to connecting with fellow librarians, researchers, and anyone interested in thoughtful approaches to data stewardship. Feel free to reach out.
